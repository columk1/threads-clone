<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

My goal is to make this pixel-perfect. I want to really nail the UX and performance to get it feeling like the real thing. I also want to work on my testing skills. The goal is to have workflows set up to run a suite of end-to-end tests on push.

### Current Status
I'm currently problem-solving how to manage optimistic updates and async state efficiently with request caching and revalidation. I will be away for most of December but when I return I will consider bringing in React Query to abstract away some of this complexity.

Apart from that, I'm chipping away at features. I still have to bring in cloud storage and media uploads which is a big one. I'm also missing many simple interactions like saving posts, reposting, sharing etc. Another significant one is 0Auth. Auth needs more work in general - especially email verification, and I would like to remove the Lucia dependency at some point, since it has been deprecated.
